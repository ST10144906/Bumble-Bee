# Bumble Bee Foundation

Bumble Bee Foundation is a web application built with ASP.NET Core and integrated with Firebase for backend services. This project is set up with a focus on secure handling of secrets and configuration for both development and production environments.

## Project Overview

The Bumble Bee Foundation project leverages Firebase for the following services:

- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication.
- **Firestore**: Real-time NoSQL database.
- **Storage**: Cloud storage for storing files.
- **Functions**: Serverless functions (not yet implemented due to associated costs).

## Running the Project

You can run the project in both development and production environments by setting the `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` variable.

### Running in Development

To run the project in the development environment, use the following commands:

```bash
set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
dotnet run
```

### Running in Production

To run the project in the production environment:

```bash
set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
dotnet run
```


## Pushing to Firebase Hosting
Note: Deployment to Firebase Hosting should only be done once the project is complete.

**Steps to Deploy**
Install Firebase CLI (if not already installed):

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

**Login to Firebase:**

```bash
firebase login
```

**Build the Project:**

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -o ./wwwroot
```

### Deploy to Firebase Hosting:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

### Access the Deployed Application:

After deployment, the Firebase CLI will provide a URL where your application is hosted.

## File Locations:
### Project Structure
- **/Controllers:** Contains the applicationâ€™s controllers, managing the flow between the user interface and backend services.
- **/Models:** Holds the data models used throughout the application.
- **/Views:** Contains the Razor views used for rendering the user interface.
- **/Services:** This folder contains all the Firebase services:
- **AuthService.cs:** Manages user authentication with Firebase.
- **FirestoreService.cs:** Handles interactions with Firebase Firestore (database).
- **StorageService.cs:** Manages file storage using Firebase Storage.
- **FunctionsService.cs:** (Not yet implemented) Will handle serverless functions using Firebase Functions.

  
### Secrets Management
- **/Secrets/**: This folder contains the Firebase service account keys. Ensure that these keys are not exposed in any public repository.
The Firebase service account key should be named **bumble-bee-foundation-firebase-adminsdk.json** and placed in this folder.

### Generating a Firebase Key and Connecting Firebase
To generate a Firebase service account key and connect it to your project:

**Generate Firebase Service Account Key:**

1. Go to your Firebase project settings.
2. Navigate to the Service Accounts tab.
3. Click on Generate new private key.
4. Download the JSON key file.

**Store the Key Securely:**

1. Rename the downloaded JSON file to **bumble-bee-foundation-firebase-adminsdk.json** 
2. Move the file to the **/Secrets** folder within your project directory.

### Paystack Payment Keys
**Please Follow the following**
1. Create a file called **paymentKeys.json** this will need to go into the **/Secrets/** Folder.
2. Add **sk_live**, **sk_test** and **public_key** in JSON fromat.

## Notes
###Environment Configuration: 
Ensure the environment is correctly configured for your deployment scenario (development or production).

###Firebase Functions:
Firebase Functions have not been implemented yet due to the costs involved. Future implementation may include this feature as needed.
